Card Images for Speed Game

To make the game work properly, you need to add card images to this directory.

Required Images:
1. card_back.png - The back of the cards
2. Card fronts in the format: card_[SUIT]_[RANK].png

For example:
- card_Hearts_1.png (Ace of Hearts)
- card_Diamonds_12.png (Queen of Diamonds)
- card_Clubs_7.png (7 of Clubs)
- card_Spades_13.png (King of Spades)

You'll need images for all combinations of:
- Suits: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades
- Ranks: 1 (Ace) through 13 (King)

Total: 1 card back + 52 card fronts = 53 images

You can find free card images online or create your own. Make sure they all have the same dimensions (recommended: 140x190 pixels).

For testing, you can start with just a few cards and add more later.
